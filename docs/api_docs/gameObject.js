/**
 * A GameObject is just a base class and typically isn't used directly. Instead, it's main purpose is to be extended by other classes, such as [Sprite](/api/sprite).
 *
 * To extend the GameObject class, import the underlying class as import {GameObjectClass}.
 *
 * You should also override the `draw()` function instead of the `render()` function in your class. The `draw()` function determines how to draw the GameObject. It is called by the `render` function after transforms and rotations have been applied.
 *
 * Do note that the canvas has been rotated and translated to the objects position (taking into account anchor), so {0,0} will be the top-left corner of the game object when drawing.

 * // exclude-code:end
 * // exclude-script:start
 * import { GameObjectClass } from 'kontra';
 * // exclude-script:end

 *   constructor(properties) {

 *     this.context.beginPath();
 *     this.context.moveTo(0, 0);
 *     this.context.lineTo(this.width, 0);
 *     this.context.lineTo(this.width / 2, this.height);
 *     this.context.fill();
