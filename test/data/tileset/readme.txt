In order to property fail the tileEngine integration test of loading a tileset image from a json file, we need a path that will not resolve when the tileset does not resolve properly. E.g. if the tileset image is `../imgs/bullet.png` and tileset data url incorrectly resoles to `https://localhost:9090/context.html`, that will resolve to `https://localhost:9090/imgs/bullet.png` which is a correct url, but an  incorrect resolve.
